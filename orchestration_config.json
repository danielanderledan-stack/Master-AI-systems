Establish interruption management protocols: designated Focus Time (no interruptions), Available Time (open to urgent matters), and Open Door Time (fully available) with clear signals for each mode. Integrate energy management using the Peak-Trough-Recovery cycle: scheduling demanding tasks during energy peaks, administrative work during energy troughs, and relationship-building during recovery phases. Apply delegation decision frameworks using the 70% Rule: delegating tasks that someone else can perform at 70% of your capability to free up time for your highest-value contributions. Implement progress tracking using the Weekly Review method: assessing completed tasks, adjusting upcoming priorities, and identifying abandonment candidates (tasks repeatedly deferred).",
    "goal_setting": "Categorize goals across key life domains: professional, financial, learning/growth, relationships, health/wellbeing, and contribution/purpose, ensuring balanced development rather than over-focusing on a single area. Apply the SMART+ framework to each goal: Specific (clear target), Measurable (trackable metrics), Achievable (challenging but possible), Relevant (aligned with values), Time-bound (clear deadline), plus Evaluated (regular review points) and Reviewed (adjustment mechanisms). Break down goals using the Milestone Method: identifying 3-5 significant progress points between current state and end goal, each with specific completion criteria. Assess resource requirements using the Four Capitals framework: financial capital (money needed), human capital (skills required), social capital (relationships/support), and time capital (hours needed). Anticipate obstacles using the Premortem technique: imagining goal failure and working backward to identify potential challenges before they occur. Develop contingency plans using the If-Then planning approach: creating specific response strategies for likely obstacles rather than generic backup plans. Create accountability systems using the Three Levels method: self-accountability (tracking tools, journals), partner accountability (regular check-ins with mentor/coach), and public accountability (shared commitments within appropriate communities). Integrate reward systems using the Reinforcement Hierarchy: immediate small rewards for milestone completion, moderate rewards for significant progress, and meaningful celebration for goal achievement.",
    "learning_summary": "Identify information hierarchy using the Pyramid Principle: main conclusion at top, supporting arguments in middle, and specific evidence/details at base, structuring from most to least important. Extract key concepts using the Five Questions method: What? (core ideas), Why? (purpose/importance), How? (processes/methods), When? (contexts/applications), and What If? (implications/extensions). Organize supporting details using appropriate frameworks: chronological (time-based processes), spatial (physical relationships), problem-solution (challenges and resolutions), compare-contrast (similarities and differences), or cause-effect (influence relationships). Create visual organization using appropriate formats: mind maps (concept relationships), flowcharts (processes), matrices (comparisons), timelines (sequences), or hierarchy charts (classifications). Map concept relationships using the Connection Web technique: identifying how key ideas relate through supporting, contrasting, extending, or qualifying relationships. Identify application opportunities using the Three Contexts framework: personal application (individual use), professional application (work setting), and teaching application (explaining to others). Develop comprehension questions using Bloom's Taxonomy: remembering (recall), understanding (explanation), applying (usage), analyzing (examination), evaluating (assessment), and creating (generation). Implement retrieval practice using the Cornell Note system: recording key information, developing questions, summarizing content, and creating regular review intervals (24hr, 1wk, 1mo) to optimize retention.",
    "interview_prep": "Anticipate questions using the STAR Matrix: categorizing likely questions (behavioral, technical, situational, motivational) crossed with key job requirements, preparing for the highest-probability intersections. Develop response frameworks using the enhanced STAR method: Situation (specific context, 10%), Task (your specific responsibility, 10%), Action (detailed steps taken, 60%), Results (quantifiable outcomes, 20%), plus Reflection (learning or improvement). Demonstrate technical knowledge through the Three-Layer approach: fundamental understanding (core principles), practical application (hands-on experience), and advanced insight (cutting-edge awareness), adjusting depth based on role requirements. Incorporate company research using the Five Levels framework: business model, recent developments, competitive landscape, culture/values, and strategic challenges, integrating these insights naturally rather than reciting facts. Present strengths using the Evidence-Based approach: stating the strength, providing specific proof points, and connecting directly to job requirements without exaggeration. Address weaknesses using the Growth Framework: honest acknowledgment, improvement actions taken, and progress demonstrated, focusing on non-critical job skills. Prepare interviewer questions using the Three Categories method: role-specific (daily responsibilities), team-related (working relationships), and organization-focused (culture, future direction), demonstrating strategic thinking. Develop follow-up communications using the Three Components approach: appreciation, specific conversation highlights, and enthusiasm for next steps, sent within 24 hours of the interview.",
    "feedback_framework": "Separate observations from interpretations using factual language to describe specific behaviors or outcomes without judgment or assumption about intent. Structure feedback using the Situation-Behavior-Impact (SBI) framework: specific context, objective description of actions, and clear explanation of effects on others or results. Balance constructive feedback with the 3:1 ratio: at least three positive observations for every improvement suggestion to maintain receptivity and motivation. Create improvement suggestions using the Future-Focus method: emphasizing desired behaviors and outcomes rather than dwelling on past mistakes. Consider timing and environment factors using the Four Conditions checklist: private setting (for constructive feedback), appropriate emotional states, sufficient time for discussion, and relevant proximity to the situation being discussed. Assess recipient receptivity using the Readiness Indicators: current stress levels, relationship trust, previous response to feedback, and alignment with personal goals. Enhance specificity using the contrast method: clearly distinguishing between what is working well and what could be improved rather than making general statements. Connect feedback to growth opportunities by identifying development resources, learning pathways, and support systems related to improvement areas."
